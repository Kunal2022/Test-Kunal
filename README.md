### `npm i`

In the project directory, you can run first for installing lib:


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\


1 Good application test so far I like so much while doing test.

2 One challange face using router modern feature including and also maintaining lesser css work.

3 If more time so
  -> Will do via scss and data manage via api so we have all track of data. so in UI we can use context as well
